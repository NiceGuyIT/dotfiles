# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# BSD specific settings
# Since imported files are lower precedent, the config is symlinked to the os-specific
# config in local/share/alacritty, which in turn imports the config in config/alacritty/.

# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#import:
#  - /path/to/alacritty.yml
# https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme
